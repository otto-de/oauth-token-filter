## [1.1.1]
### Changed
- Corrected the logic for filling out forms. Now, when you do not provide the OAuthTokenFilter
with a Username or Password, it will not enter them into the form as "null"
- The Builder class now correctly builds a new client if you do not provide it with one.
- You are now able to change the grant_type parameter for more flexibility. If none is provided,
it defaults to password.

### Added
- Unit test to reflect the correct way of filling out forms with null values.

## [1.1.0]

- Support for "expires_in" field in OAuth2-tokens

## [1.0.3]

in the createObjectBuilder() function.
